# SphereTest Descriptions
SphereTest16_goodOne folder contains all the code uploaded to web site: http://masonsunyin.pythonanywhere.com/polls/

SphereTestBaby folder is the code that uses the baby step data (Test4Nodes), which we can run to see the issues.

SphereTest18 uses the latest data (not the baby steps data). Run to visually check the issues in clusters.

LastFMforPaper has all scenarios of plot. Each is a independent project. The SphereLastFMFinal is the the formal one.
